# Easily reconfigure Camunda Standalone Webapp by a proper build

This simple Maven project shows how you can reconfigure the [Camunda standalone webapp](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/installation/standalone-webapplication/) by a proper build process.

The example just changes the database settings, but you can easily extend this to adjust the web.xml, e.g. to hook in SSO.
